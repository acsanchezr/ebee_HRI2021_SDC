# Ebee project

Ebee is a social robot developed for the robot student competition at the 2021 ACM/IEEE International Conference on Human-Robot Interaction. 
Ebee was designed to help users stop using biased language. For example, a user that tends to refer to a group of people as "guys" might want to change that term for a more gender-inclusive one. This project contains the Flutter application that allows users to store the words that they wish to become more aware of.
